From Digital Forensics Research at Bloomsburg University of Pennsylvania it was found that the 
Virtual Disk Image VDI File (Popular and Default with VirtualBox) is incompatible with popular forensics tools such as FTK and EnCase.  This tool converts a VDI file to a raw format with hashing integrety checks included.
